# RSS Archiver
[WIP] Download and archive RSS feeds to Wayback Machine. Save a list of archived feed in locad db. I have little idea what I am doing. This is my learn to code project. Suggestion and comment are welcome and apricciated.

# To-do
- Implement a way to use Wayback Machine API (S3 Keys)
- Option to trigger saving outlinks from RSS links. Don't save outlinks to archive.db
- Make sure rss_feeds table should only allow unique entries.
